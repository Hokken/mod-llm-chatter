invaded from underground, and hostile ice trolls lurk in the mountains. Coldridge
Valley is where young dwarves and gnomes begin their journey. The air is crisp,
the ale is strong, and the mountains echo with the sound of gunfire and hammers.""",

    12: """Elwynn Forest: Peaceful human farmland outside Stormwind, but trouble
brews beneath the surface. Kobolds infest the mines crying "you no take candle,"
the Defias Brotherhood threatens the roads, and gnolls raid from the borders.
Goldshire inn is always lively. A deceptively calm zone with danger lurking.""",

    38: """Loch Modan: A mountainous region dominated by a massive lake. Troggs
and kobolds plague the area, while Dark Iron dwarves cause trouble near the dam.
The great dam is an engineering marvel. Thelsamar is a quiet town of hunters and
excavators. The landscape feels rugged and frontier-like.""",

    40: """Westfall: Once fertile farmland, now dusty and abandoned. The Defias
Brotherhood controls much of the region from their hidden base. Homeless farmers
wander the roads, mechanical harvest watchers patrol empty fields, and gnolls
scavenge the edges. Sentinel Hill stands as the last bastion of order.""",

    44: """Redridge Mountains: A besieged human territory. Blackrock orcs pour
down from the mountains, gnolls roam freely, and the town of Lakeshire desperately
holds on. The bridge is always under threat. A zone that feels like a warfront,
with citizens caught in the crossfire.""",

    10: """Duskwood: Perpetually dark, cursed forest shrouded in eternal night.
Undead shamble through the woods, worgen howl in the darkness, and giant spiders
lurk everywhere. Darkshire's Night Watch barely holds back the horrors. An
unsettling zone where something terrible happened and the land never recovered.""",

    11: """Wetlands: Soggy marshland connecting the dwarven lands to Lordaeron.
Hostile crocolisks and raptors everywhere, Dark Iron dwarves scheme in the hills,
and dragonkin threaten from the northeast. Menethil Harbor is a rain-soaked port
town. Everything here is damp and slightly miserable.""",

    # Eastern Kingdoms - Horde Starting Zones
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    85: """Tirisfal Glades: Haunted forest surrounding the Undercity. The land
itself feels diseased - sickly trees, green fog, and restless undead. Scarlet
Crusade zealots hunt anything undead, while mindless zombies and bats roam freely.
Brill is a grim town of the Forsaken. The atmosphere is gothic and melancholic.""",

    130: """Silverpine Forest: Dark, misty woods south of Tirisfal. Worgen have
overrun much of the forest, and the Scourge presence lingers. Shadowfang Keep
looms ominously. The Forsaken fight for every inch of territory. A zone caught
between multiple threats, feeling isolated and dangerous.""",

    267: """Hillsbrad Foothills: Contested farmland where Horde and Alliance
clash openly. Southshore and Tarren Mill are in constant conflict. Yetis roam
the mountains, and the Syndicate bandits cause trouble. A zone defined by
faction warfare and old grudges.""",

    # Eastern Kingdoms - Mid-Level Zones
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    47: """The Hinterlands: Remote forested highlands, home to the Wildhammer
dwarves and forest trolls locked in eternal conflict. Wolves and owlbeasts roam
the wilds. Aerie Peak sits atop a massive cliff. The zone feels untamed and
far from civilization.""",

    45: """Arathi Highlands: Rolling grasslands dotted with ancient ruins. The
Syndicate controls Stromgarde's ruins, ogres inhabit the caves, and raptors hunt
the plains. Refuge Pointe and Hammerfall eye each other warily. A windswept
frontier zone with echoes of fallen kingdoms.""",

    33: """Stranglethorn Vale: Dense, dangerous jungle teeming with life. Trolls,
pirates, raptors, tigers, and gorillas everywhere. Booty Bay is a lawless goblin
port where anything goes. Nesingwary's hunting expedition draws adventurers.
The zone is beautiful but deadly - something wants to eat you around every corner.""",

    3: """Badlands: Harsh, barren desert of red rock and dust. Hostile troggs,
coyotes, and black dragon whelps make travel dangerous. Scattered archaeology
sites hint at ancient secrets. Kargath is a rough Horde outpost. A zone that
feels desolate and unforgiving.""",

    8: """Swamp of Sorrows: Murky, depressing swampland. Lost ones wander aimlessly,
jaguars stalk the waters, and the Temple of Atal'Hakkar draws dark worshippers.
Everything is wet, muddy, and slightly hopeless. A forgotten corner of the world.""",

    4: """Blasted Lands: Scarred wasteland corrupted by the Dark Portal's energies.
Demons, mutated wildlife, and fel creatures roam freely. The very ground feels
wrong. Nethergarde Keep watches the Portal nervously. A zone that feels like the
edge of the world, where everything went wrong.""",

    51: """Searing Gorge: Volcanic wasteland controlled by Dark Iron dwarves.
Lava flows, fire elementals, and slag pits dominate the landscape. Thorium Point
is a small outpost of resistance. Brutally hot and industrially ravaged.""",

    46: """Burning Steppes: Blackrock orcs and black dragons rule this scorched
land. The Blackrock Spire looms overhead. Fire elementals and dragonkin patrol.
A high-level warzone where the Dark Horde masses its forces.""",

    # Eastern Kingdoms - Plaguelands
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    28: """Western Plaguelands: Diseased farmland crawling with undead. Andorhal
is a ruined city contested by multiple factions. The Scourge presence is heavy,
and Cauldrons spread plague across the land. The Scarlet Crusade fights
fanatically. A zone of death, disease, and desperate struggles.""",

    139: """Eastern Plaguelands: The Scourge's heartland. Undead everywhere -
ghouls, abominations, necromancers. Stratholme burns eternally, Naxxramas floats
overhead. Light's Hope Chapel is humanity's last stand. The most corrupted,
dangerous zone on the continent. Hope is scarce here.""",

    41: """Deadwind Pass: Desolate canyon leading to Karazhan. Deadwind ogres lurk
in caves, restless spirits wander, and demonic corruption seeps from the tower.
The land itself feels drained of life. Creepy, empty, and ominous - something
terrible happened here.""",

    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Kalimdor - Alliance Starting Zones
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    141: """Teldrassil: Massive world tree home to the night elves. Despite some
troubles with hostile Gnarlpine furbolgs and timberlings, the forest remains
breathtakingly beautiful - ancient trees glow softly at twilight, moonwells
shimmer with arcane energy, and peaceful glades invite quiet reflection.
Darnassus sits serenely above the canopy. The air carries whispers of old
magic. Night elves go about daily life: training, crafting, tending gardens.
A place where nature's beauty persists even as adventurers deal with threats.""",

    148: """Darkshore: Long, misty coastline where fog rolls in from the sea,
creating an ethereal atmosphere. Ancient night elf ruins hold mysteries and
forgotten lore. Auberdine bustles with travelers catching boats to Teldrassil,
Stormwind, or Azuremyst Isle. Fishermen work the docks, adventurers trade
stories at the inn. Yes, murlocs and naga cause trouble on the beaches, and
some wildlife has turned aggressive - but the coastline's haunting beauty
endures. Moonlit shores, ancient architecture, the sound of waves. A zone
of contrasts: peaceful harbors and dangerous wilds, old magic and new threats.""",

boars roam the red canyons. Quilboar raid from the south, and Burning Blade
cultists hide in caves. Orgrimmar's gates welcome warriors. A zone that embodies
the Horde's strength through adversity.""",

    215: """Mulgore: Peaceful rolling plains of the tauren. Kodo beasts graze
lazily, but harpies swoop from the mountains and Venture Co. goblins exploit the
land. Thunder Bluff rises on its mesas. The most serene Horde zone - wide skies
and gentle winds, though danger lurks at the edges.""",

    17: """The Barrens: Vast, dry savanna stretching endlessly. Centaur, quilboar,
raptors, lions, and zhevra everywhere. The Crossroads is a major hub where
adventurers gather. Known for long travel times and memorable general chat.
A defining Horde leveling experience.""",

marred by war and corruption.""",

depressing places in Azeroth.""",

an Alliance fortress. The ruins of a burned inn hint at darker plots.
Oppressively muggy and dangerous.""",
